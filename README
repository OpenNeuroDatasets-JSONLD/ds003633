*****ForrestGump-MEG: A audio-visual movie watching MEG dataset*****

For details please refer to our paper on [].

This dataset contains MEG data recorded from 11 subjects while watching the 2h long Chinese-dubbed audio-visual movie 'Forrest Gump'. The data were acquired with a 275-channel CTF MEG. Auxiliary data (T1w) as well as derivation data such as preprocessed data and MEG-MRI co-registration are also included. 


**Pre-process procedure description**

The T1w images stored as NIFTI files were minimally-preprocessed using the anatomical preprocessing pipeline from fMRIPrep with default settings. 

MEG data were pre-processed using MNE following a three-step procedure: 1. bad channels were detected and removed. 2. a high-pass filter of 1 Hz was applied to remove possible slow drifts from the continuous MEG data. 3. artifacts removal was performed with ICA.


**Stimulus material**

The audio-visual stimulus material was from the Chinese-dubbed 'Forrest Gump' DVD released in 2013 (ISBN: 978-7-7991-3934-0), which cannot be publicly released here due to copyright restrictions.



**Dataset content overview**

the data were organized following the MEG-BIDS using MNE-BIDS toolbox.
